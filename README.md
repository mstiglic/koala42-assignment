# Technical Assessment
_Front-end Developer_

### Description
Please, develop an application which creates a hierarchy table from input data in JSON
format.

Every item in JSON consists of its own data and array, which items represent child data.
Item&#39;s data can have a variable number of attributes (key: value), and item can have a
variable number of nested child items. When you click on an item, direct child items are
hidden/shown.

There are two attachments in the email you were sent. In those, you can see an example of
data in JSON and an example screenshot of the hierarchy table component.

Use the attached “example-data.json” and create the hierarchy table application (similar to
the screenshot). The application has data and view layers, which are clearly separated.
Implement a &quot;remove&quot; button, which deletes an item in the data and view layer in your
application. If an item has children items, they have to be deleted as well.

### Scope
- Usage of React.js/Vue/Angular
- Usage of state management of your choice
- Structure of medium-size production application
- Focus on code quality, correct usage of chosen technologies, data consistency
- Design is not important
- (Optional) Write down known issues and what you would done different if you have
more time
